# VBAView
VBA extractor and pcode parser.

This application has been built in Delphi 10.2 by Embarcadero Technologies, and is based on the work of Dr. Vesselin Bontchev, pcodedmp.py

I used the SynEdit controls, for syntax highlighting in Delphi.

In addition, I created an UserForm in VBA, that performs a limited similar extraction of the source code only.
